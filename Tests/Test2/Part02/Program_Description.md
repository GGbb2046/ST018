## Program Description

1. This program will enable fetching of currency and stock information from a financial api - Alpha Vantage. The program converts the data into a json structure, perform analysis and spits results of the analysis in a json format, driven by a command line argument.

2. There are two analysis available to the user.
    - The user may be able to either check the current exchange rate and fetch the amount of domestic currency one could exchange for a input foreign currency with the spread information.

    - or, the user may inquire about the current price of a stock complementing it with a time series plot of the stock prices.

3. The program recapitulates key programming concepts discussed in class:
    - Command line arguments
    - If else statements
    - While loops
    - For loops
    - Creating Dictionaries and lists
    - Fetching data from both the above data structures
    - Converting one data structure to the next
    - Using Json file structures
    - Calling data from API's using unique API code.
    - Use of operators - arithmetic and logical 
    - Use of matplotlyb for graphical interface
    - Exception handling 

I would like to sincerely thank our professor, Dr. Tim Smith for his support and collaboration in making our learning intuitive and enlightening.
