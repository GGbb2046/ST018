# Tests

Part1:

Thank you for the update (and very nice to see the screen captures)

Part2: 

One issue -- if a user enters a prime number greater than 2000, you will print that this is not prime. This is misleading -- and a better approach would be to output an error.


Part3:

A couple of issues. The first is that you were to create a function. Also, if you create a function - as discussed in class, if your objective is to create and test a function, then you should put your test cases inside the main program (asking the user for input doesn't aLlow up to see what was tested, or easily (and automatically) repeat these tests if we make changers)
