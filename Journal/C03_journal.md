•	Code version system aka version control systems
•	Microsoft Azure similar to github

# Summary of last class
1.	Git clone <Address>
2.	Git init
3.	Presence of .git file
4.	Git add <>
5.	Git add – A: anything down
6.	Git commit – needs a message >> Git commit -m
7.	Git push – only the stuff that’s been committed is updated
8.	Git push origin master; origin stands for git hub
9.	Git remote add origin <address>
10.	Status of remote: Git remote -v
11.	Git pull origin master (branch from the server)
12.	Git log – history of all the commits

**Python is case specific**
1. Text files
2. Variables, operators and expressions
3. A statement is something that does not produce any value
4. An expression pushes a value
5. Any expression has a number of operators and operands

**Two ways of running python**
1.  Using a prompt – testing objects (Interactive mode)
2.  Executing all the codes at one time 
•	Mac’s come default with Python2; we’d have to use python3 in the bash prompt to get it started
•	Binary operators require two operands

**Operand types**
1. Int – as integer (whole number)
2. 3.14 – floating point
3. A and B – true or false – type Boolean output (bool)
4. “hills” – strings
5. INT, BOOL, STRING, FLOAT

**Operator types**
1. ** _power
2. // Floor Division – 9 divided by  - 4.5 – truncates of the floating point  - number of sets in a digit e.g 9//2
3. % Modulo – is the remainder 9%2 = 1
e.g. 183 seconds to time(mm:ss):  183//60:: 183%60

*There may be issues with bugs as Python’s variables can be dynamically modeled into different variable types.*

#Strings

*You can use both single and double quotes provided you use the same symbol at the beginning and at the end*

#Variables
1. Variables can be letters, numbers and underscores
2. Variables cannot start with a number
3. Spaces are not allowed in variable names

# There is no way of declaring a variable in python as it changes as the user modifies the input.

1. Concatenation: “A” + “B” > AB
2. Running the program: Python <program file.py>
3. Output
4. Print (“The value is = “ + str(10))
5. Print ( “The value is”, x)

# Input
Print (“Welcome to Area of circle “)
Radius = int(input (“Please enter a radius value”)) – kind of like of expression that acts as a function call
The input will be received as a string.
A = 3.14 * radius **2
Print(“the area of circle with radius ”, radius, “is”, A)
R = (FV/PV)**(1/n) + 1



#Turtle
We can call on libraries by using import function,
We can build our own modules and function
turtle.Turtle – module.function
