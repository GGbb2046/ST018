#### Unfortunately, we missed our professor due to illness. We hope to see him in the next class. Take care professor.
##### However, there were 4 exercises that were undertaken watching the videos to the link.

1. C06Ex01 was similar to what we covered on the test. We created a pull request based on changes to a read only public repo. We performed this on an existing file.

2. Upon creating a pull request, a fork is displayed in our repo list. Under the next exercise, we cloned the fork of the public repo where we performed a pull request. We started working on it, making changes, addition and deletion.

3. Upon making changes to the fork, we again pulled request to the upstream repo which was a foreign repo created by our professor for testing purposes.

4. We also had an exercise where we performed a synch between changes in the local and git hub repo. We performed a pull orgin master, synched the git hub repo to the local, made changes in the local and pushed it upstream.

## question to the professor:
    a. what is a sub module.
    b. for class 6 exercises, i have made a public repo inside one of the exercises folder.
