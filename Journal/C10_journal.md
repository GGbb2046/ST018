## Exception handling
Static analysis:
### Simply a code review – a combination by hand and tools 

### 

__Try:__ 
I = int(Input(“your name”)

__Except:__
	Print(“…….”)
•	When you have multiple messages only one exception can be troublesome.
•	Always be specific and keep the trial blocks small.

## Cycle: Build >> Test >> Deploy
1. Running bandit at the integration server, checks and pushes into the CVS 
2. Conversion to exe file  video posted on black board.
## nowadays we run sorting at a lower level language and compile it in a higher level.
